                    <p>My name is Shane and I am studying Computer Science at Montana State University in Bozeman, MT. 
                    <br><br>
                    I love creating what I think are fun and imaginative games on my free time, which was more so before
                    I came to college. I also enjoy creating applications that make my life and other peoples lives easier. 
                    Many of my projects have tested my skills and required me to learn new things and come up with unique
                    approaches to solve the problems I hadn't forseen. Each of these challenges have made the games and programs
                    I have worked on that much more exciting and awesome when they are finished.
                    <br><br>
                    <p><b>This website is dedicated to showing some of the many programs I have developed on my free time over the
                    years and will be ever changing.</b></p>
